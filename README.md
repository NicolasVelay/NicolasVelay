##  👨🏻‍💻 About me

* 📐 I design interfaces and code them, I like to push the limits of what I know. Working on a design system.
* 🔐 Currently learning about devops and cloud security.
* 🕵 CTF and escape game enjoyer.
* 🎹 I also, sometimes, when I have time, have non-tech hobbies, like playing [Claire de lune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGJPVl7iQUM).

###### 😆 Fun fact: I made my father quit putting me parental controls when I was 12 because I was bypassing them to play more.
